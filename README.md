# OpenCV Basics in Python

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring **OpenCV fundamentals in Python**. The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with core computer vision operations such as image manipulation, filtering, edge detection, and basic feature extraction, rather than building a single end application.

The work focuses on turning tutorial-style concepts into **runnable, experiment-driven code** to build practical intuition for computer vision workflows.

## Topics Covered

### Image I/O and Color Spaces

* Reading and writing images and video streams
* Converting between **BGR, RGB, and grayscale**
* Resizing, cropping, flipping, and basic geometric transformations

### Drawing and Annotation

* Drawing lines, rectangles, circles, and text on images
* Creating blank canvases and synthetic images for practice

### Image Processing Operations

* Blurring and smoothing (average, Gaussian, median)
* Thresholding (global and adaptive) for simple segmentation
* Morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening, and closing

### Edge and Contour Detection

* Canny edge detection and parameter tuning
* Finding, drawing, and approximating contours
* Bounding boxes and shape approximation

### Feature-Level Exploration

* Detecting corners and simple features
* Observing how filters and transformations affect feature maps

### Video and Real-Time Processing

* Capturing frames from webcam or video files
* Applying real-time filters and overlays in a processing loop

## Learning Objectives

* Become comfortable with OpenCV’s Python API and image array conventions
* Understand how low-level computer vision operations work in practice
* Build intuition for how these primitives support higher-level tasks such as object detection, tracking, and segmentation

These notebooks serve as a **foundation for future computer vision projects**, including real-time and deep learning–based applications.
